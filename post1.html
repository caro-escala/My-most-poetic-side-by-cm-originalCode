              Even though he can’t boast about his size (he measures between 4 and 7 cm), this <em>“prince in disguise”</em> has -in fact- a well-saved secret that overtakes our imagination.
              Well, not everyone’s imagination really, as Walt Disney himself has proposed this tool for his survival.
              <br>

              <br>
              Actually, we don’t know if  Walt was really frozen before death, though, or if everything is a bewildering myth. There are those who say that he is dead, but also those who claim  that he is under zero since 1966, waiting for the cure of cancer.
              Unfortunately, we can’t shed light on that mystery, albeit it is arguable that a person with that amount of money can do whatever he wants. So, it wouldn’t be surprising if sooner or later, Walt Disney comes to the spotlight again with a new cartoon movie with <em> “white walkers" </em>in it.
              <br>
              <br> But let’s go back to the main character of this story, the frog, for a change.

              <strong>Whether this is the outcome of an evil spell or not, we can’t say,</strong> but <em>  Lithobates sylvaticus</em> is one of the four species in the USA that stops breathing during the whole winter to wake up in the summer. <em>Is the kiss of a lady frog needed?</em> It doesn’t seem so.
              <br>
              <br>
              This frog is classified as <strong> extremophile</strong>, due to its capacity to beat extreme temperatures and survive, and how he does this is the most important and interesting detail: it freezes itself in solid-state. I know that this sounds like science-fiction! <br> 
              The liquid present in the body of the frog becomes ice in 65%, while the rest is affected by a high level of glucose produced by the liver on purpose of this event, given that it acts as anticoagulant. It's understood that <em> "the secret of life" </em>is that the frog has some nucleoproteins that avoid the formation of big crystals of ice, which could damage the inner organs. Also, he is able to support this irregular concentration of sugar, which is threatening to humans.

              For narrative purposes, in my tale it seems that the returning to life of the frog is an immediate miracle, but that’s not the truth. The process of ice melting can last from several minutes to many hours, more likely the last one. The heart is the first organ in undertaking its function to secure the blood irrigation needed for the rest of the organs and the body.
              <br>
              <br>
              Having said that, I want to share with you other scientific information regarding <em> “Lithobates sylvaticus” </em>that I find very amusing.
              <br><br>
              The mating requires  a “try and err” method, because they lack the hability of sex recognition. So, what males do is to embrace other frogs (males too!) in the breeding pond and just let free the ones that aren’t <strong> “fat enough”</strong> to be carrying a lot of eggs (thus, not female ones). 
              <br>
              <br>
              Also, they are able to recognize their own family, tending to form groups among brothers and hang out together, leaving aside the not kin ones. <em> What a lovely species!!!</em>
              <br>
              <br>
              And finally, amphibians in general constitute an important indicator of environmental health. So, for a world more full of amazing frogs and less of fictional princes, if you come across a frog, please, just let it be.
              <br>
              <br>
              <strong> Without further to do, I say goodbye for now! Until the next post!</strong>
