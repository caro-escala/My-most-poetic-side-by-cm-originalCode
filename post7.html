                    <strong>Dung beetles</strong> are coleopteran insects that not only consume feces as breakfast as their name clearly indicates, but also carrion (corpses), mushrooms, rotten fruit, and other decomposing material.<strong><em>They are very fond of nasty smells!</em></strong><br><br>
                    But they have a picky palate, although! They rather omnivore dung to herbivore dung, and as a matter of fact, <em>our</em> crap and chimpanzee crap are their favorite! <strong>I'm not kidding!</strong> This was proved by a research involving 9000 dung beetles from 15 different species made by the Entomological Society of America.<br><br>
                    Dung beetles gather the “raw material” from nature, model it and roll it to the place where they want to put it, showing a very skilled coordination: they lean on the front legs and push with the rear ones. The whole movement consumes a lot of energy.

                    What do you do when you are too warm?<br>
                    Well, dump beetles use the ball of poop for keeping them fresh, putting their legs inside of it. Also they regurgitate in their legs and then rub their face, to diminish the overwarming of their head. <strong>Nasty but smart!</strong><br>
                    In the picture we can see one of the subjects of the experiment performed. He has silicone gloves that maintain the low temperature longer, so the beetle climbed the dung ball less times than the control group, with bare “hands”.<br><br>
                    <strong>Also, the poop is used to bring life to Earth.</strong><br>
                    Females dung beetles divide the excrement from the ball collected by the male into 3 or 4 portions and put them into the ground.  These are known as Nest Balls. In each of them she lays an egg,  from which a new beetle will emerge. The whole process takes 28 days.

                    It was proved that dung beetles are the beings with the most strength in the world, in terms of weight lifted vs. body weight. They're capable of lifting nothing less than <strong> 1.141 times their own weight!!!!</strong> This surpases a lot of big animals' power, but the thing is that dung beetles are tiny insects, with light body structure to maintain, so they can afford the use of energy in… <strong><em>pushing poop</em></strong>. It's known by experts in the field that if we had a machine like the Avengers have, and we could make these insects bigger, they would lose their power. 
                    <img id= "picture5" src="imagenes/post7_5.jpg" alt="Condor with his wings unfolded">
                    This strength is very important to fight with competitors. When another male enters the den (it has the form of a tunnel) the dung beetle has to push the other one out. That's why another strategy is used: <em> steal the ball of dung after all the work done by a competitor and go to impress the princess with the feast without spending too much effort.</em>

                    I may have a problem, but I find <em>something romantic</em> about all the stars in Marvelous Dwellers Collection. Also in this case!<br><br>
                    Dung beetles use <strong>the sun </strong>as reference for diurnal orientation, and <strong> moonlight and celestial objects</strong> in the sky during the night. Thus, they can go in a straight line to their den, without unnecessary deviation. For these, once they are atop the dung ball, they “dance” to take mental pictures of the sky and stock them in their brains. Recently it was discovered that when no one of these options work (very specific moments in the day) they use <strong>wind</strong>.<br><br>
                    To figure out all about this system of orientation, an artificial planetarium in South Africa was mounted. There, scientists could change the position of the stars, the light, the wind… The outcomes pretend to help the development of navigation systems for autonomous vehicles.

                    Once more, we have in my blog a species that <strong>should be more appreciated and recognized.</strong><br> 
                    Dung beetles' activity has a very positive impact on the environment, making the soil more aerated when the buried the ball of scrap and fertilizing the land with the re-entry of organic matter into it. Also, they spread seeds.<br>
                    <img id= "picture8" src="imagenes/post7_8.jpg" alt="Condor"><br>
                    Scientists say the accumulation of faeces would be unbearable for the ecosystem otherwise. It was calculated that coprophages bury 1.5 tons of fecal material per hectare each year, helping to diminish the spread of parasites and pathogens. <em>Stand up everybody and clap for dung beetles!!!</em> 
                    <img id= "picture9" src="imagenes/post7_9.gif" alt="Condor"><br>
                    As they depend directly on other animals' deposition for food and nesting, it is one of the groups most used in biodiversity studies. They're very vulnerable to wild habitat destruction.

                    I don't know you but I learnt a lot during the research of the scientific reason for the blue balls! It gave me a lot to think about!<br>
                    <br>
                    What would have been of us as species if sexual selection had imposed the same pattern that our cousins, the velvet monkeys, have?... Or if that phenomenon, the Tyndall effect, had implied an advantage in the natural environment so it had spread to the whole body...?<br>
                    <br>
                    Can you imagine our lives as huge pitufos, a less impulsive beast from X-man movies or like avatars from Pandora…?<br>
                    From my point of view, the sculpture <strong>“King Kong Balls”</strong>, made by the french artist Denis Defrancesco and exhibited in Czech Republic in 2019, is close enough to that envision in my mind…<br>

                I start to think that we -humans- related everything to immortality.<br><br>
                Curiously, in Egipt the dung beetles were a symbol of life and power. Amulets with the shape of this insect were used to get protection against evil and improve strength to overcome jeopardy. Once dead, the amulet next to the corpse was supposed to make possible resurrection and the reborning to a new and eternal life.
