                    Something that makes our life more precious is the certainty that <strong>someday we all will die</strong>. That prompts the core tenet of making our footprint meaningful, of living our life in a way that our friends may remember us with a warm-heart, with a candid smile on their face…
                    <br>
                    I suppose that the same reason is what makes us to be obsessed with death. Nobody knows what happens after, if there is another experience of life or a complete nothingness… Some people are very afraid of that moment. And somehow, we try to avoid as much as we can that irreversible instance in which our life ends. We address too many economic resources to the discovery of the <em>secret of youth</em>, to figure it out what could prolong our life, how to be closer to <strong>immortality</strong>.
                    <br><br>
                    But why? After all, the pass of every single living being in the world is just transitory…

                    They arrived at the stardom as <em><strong>“the immortal jellyfishes”</strong></em>, but they resemble more to a genuine Benjamin Button case, given the fact that they reverse their adult age to the polyp stage and start over. To go deep, they can <em>“rejuvenate”</em> in any moment of their life, <strong>several times</strong>, and in each one, the <strong>genetic code is exactly the same as the original</strong>.<br>

Basically, they shrinks in on themselves, reabsorb their tentacles and lose the ability to swim, remaining attached to the marine surface in a juvenile polyp state.<br>

                    Nevertheless, the slow rhythmic movement of the jellyfish propulsing itself in the water makes me fall into a musicalized fantasy that conveys me peace and quietness.… I chill out and float, balancing unwillingly under the effects of the streams, dancing vals with the ocean... And I find it very hypnotic and beautiful…

                        Now, let’s stop the swinging, leave my imagination behind and come back to reality. In spite of this crazy circle of life in which jellyfishes were prized, <strong>they can, in fact, die</strong>. Don’t fool yourself, then!: if you have a second chance to be here, and by serendipity, you reborn being an <em>“immortal”</em> jellyfish, bear in mind that <strong>you are a dessert</strong> for whales, sharks, marine turtles, crabs, some marine birds and even some fishes. So, run jellyfish, run!<br>

                        After that awkward reference to Forrest Gump, I want to make it clear for you: unfortunately, these “immortal” jellyfishes usually have a <em> very short life in nature</em>. <br>
                        I guess that it seems to be a bad joke of destiny, but that makes sense for me… <strong> A life lacking risk doesn’t sound too much to be living...</strong> <br><br>Maybe it’s better just to be a mortal human after all: we have more time to discover all the marvels that the world has hidden at the view, like these adamant jellyfish that refuse to die and live like <strong>goddesses</strong> instead, challenging the first biological principle, that <strong>one day we all will breathe our last</strong>.

                    These jellyfishes not only share the amazing hability of <strong>"reset"</strong> themselves to avoid any surrounding risk. They also are very aggressive <strong>invaders</strong>. It's believed that immortal jellyfishes are from the Mediterranean Sea, but nowadays they are found in all the oceans.<br>
                    Nevertheless, we seem to be the reason of this strong spread. It turns out that jellyfishes take advantages of <strong><em>"hitchhiking"</em></strong> in ships to <em>disperse their genes</em> all around the world.<br>
                    I really enjoyed this piece of information because traveling and knowing new places are amazing things to do if you have an <em>neverending</em> life. And more if it's free of charges!!!<br>
