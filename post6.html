                    I have presented marvelous dwellers from all over the world, but today <strong>I came home</strong> to set up the scene of this tale.<br><br>
                    In our Andes mountains, in South America, there is a species that stars antique legends, takes part in an invaluable responsability in nature and owns many titles of being "the most..." in several things.<br><br><br><br>
                    This criature seems to be able to stop the clock when it appears like by art of magic in the sky. His black and white tones show and hide among clouds and mountains, very playfulness, very misterious, very presumptuous... Viewers amaze upon the majestic presence of this marvelous dweller… <strong>Vultus Gryphus</strong>... or <strong>the Andean condor</strong>.

                    Andean Condor has several “awards” of being “the most”...<br><br>
                    You probably already know the first fact I'm going to present: he is <strong>the biggest bird in the entire world</strong>: males use to reach almost 1.5 metres from the peak to the tail, 1 metre of height and incredibly 3 metres, give or take, from one wing to another. Males weigh between 10 and 15 k.<br><br>
                    But that’s not all: Andean Condor is one of the birds that <strong>can live longer</strong> , around 75 years.</li><br><br>
                    <img id= "picture3" src="imagenes/post6_3.jpg" alt="Condor">
                    To continue the list, he is also the bird with the ability to <strong>fly higher than others!</strong> He can achieve <span id= "wow">6.500 metres</span> of altitude using vertical streams of warm air.<br><br>
                    <!--efecto de volar de la pagina-->
                    He is <strong> master of saving energy too</strong>: he can glide hundreds of metres with his wings unfolded and without moving a <em>single muscle</em>. He can hold this <span id= "wow">for more than 5 hours</span>, and if he chooses the route well, he can cover more than 170km. It turns out that the effort of beating the wings is extremely harsh for the bird, so he spends at least 75% of that only in departure, remaining in a glide position the rest of the time and beating wings once in a while.

                    Andean condors fulfill an important role in the ecosystem.<br><br> They are <strong>scavengers</strong>, meaning that they tear apart <em>skin and tissue of dead animals</em> to feed with. This special and nasty task helps minor scavengers to do their part in the process, because Condors can open the belly directly, given access to inner organs <em> faster</em>. Otherwise, minor scavengers has "a long rode to ride" but, <em>chill out, I will reserve the gross details for <strong>"my daskest side"</strong></em>. So, if Condor is near the "end of the existance" of another animal, we can say that it woukd be <strong>a feast </strong>for all the scavengers in the field!<br><br>
                    Even though this sounds abhorrent indeed, it allows the erasing of the signs of death of other species and the prevention of the spread of some kind of bacterias that could harm humans or cause diseases. <strong>Thanks Condors!!!</strong><br> 
                    A single condor can eat 5 kilos of meat per day, but also they can fast for five weeks. Their ability to view at long distance is paramount for holding their feeding.

                   And there is more! A legend tells that the world had been destroyed by water and fire in a huge storm and that the Andean Condor had been the only one survivor, thanks to his mastery in flying skills that made it possible to avoid the catastrophe. Thus, his supposed longevity in the universe would explained not only the wrinkles and baldness of Andean Condor, but also why he is respected as a wise being in Earth: <strong> he saw the birth of a new world, the world in which we live now…</strong></p>

                    Andean condor is considered as a cultural and natural heritage of all South America and, at the same time, in Argentina at least, this species is in the vulnerable category. In Mendoza, Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego is declared a Natural Monument and protected by Provincial Law for the conservation of native fauna. There are natural reserves of Condor and captive breeding programs in many countries. Accordingly the source, their definitive release to the environment leads to satellite monitoring through NASA transmitters with updated delivery of position data and monitoring by experts.<br>

                    I don’t know you but I learnt a lot during the research of the scientific reason for the blue balls! It gave me a lot to think about!<br>
                    <br>
                    What would have been of us as species if sexual selection had imposed the same pattern that our cousins, the velvet monkeys, have?... Or if that phenomenon, the Tyndall effect, had implied an advantage in the natural environment so it had spread to the whole body...?<br>
                    <br>
                    Can you imagine our lives as huge pitufos, a less impulsive beast from X-man movies or like avatars from Pandora…?<br>
                    From my point of view, the sculpture <strong>“King Kong Balls”</strong>, made by the french artist Denis Defrancesco and exhibited in Czech Republic in 2019, is close enough to that envision in my mind…<br>

                There are some more curiosities about Condor that are worthies to explore!<br><br>
                For instance, for my total surprise, they <strong>are mute</strong>. They have their syrinx (vocal organ in birds) damaged. <em>I bet that you didn’t know that, right!? Me neither, clearly!</em><br><br>
                Another thing is that Andean condor use to <strong>defecate or urinate over himself in order to "refresh"</strong>  the high temperature of his paws, mainly. This process is called "urohydrosis", and is the reason why his legs are often dyed white (due to the uric acid). This practice is common among Vultures.<br><br>
                Of course I wouln't like you to remember the Andean Condor as a nasty species that pee or poop on himself, so I want to close with something romantic to balance the story.<br>
                Andean condors are loyals to their couple. They are monogamous and make real the expression <strong><em> “until death breaks us apart”.</em></strong>. He may have an ugly face but the manners of a sweet and romantic gentleman can conquer anyone! Here we have <span id="wow">"a romantic kiss (with bad breath, definitely)"</span>.<br>

              <strong> Without further to do, I say goodbye for now! Until the next post!</strong>
